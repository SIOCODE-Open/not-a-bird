# Not a Bird

üìñ [Click here to read the old readme](./README.old.md)

üöÄ Welcome to **Not a Bird**! This repository contains our submission for the _Polkadot Global 2024: North America Edition_.

üîó _Not a Bird_ is a _blockchain game_, which involved _crafting_, _trading_ and _collectively working towards a goal_ so that players are _rewarded_. This readme contains technical information about the game, such as _how to build it_, and explanation of _some parts of the code_.

üë®‚Äçüéì If you just want to learn about the game, [look at the game documentation here](https://polkadot-global-na-2024-not-a-bird-docs.surge.sh/).

# Dependencies

To build and run the game, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

* For the **frontend** of the game (_1_):
    * Node.JS 20 and npm
    * `substrate-contracts-node`
* For the **backend** of the game (_2_):
    * Rust
    * `cargo contract`

Here is a quick script, which has been tested on `Ubuntu 22.04`, and sets up the necessary tools for building:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential make automake pkg-config curl git unzip zip
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
rustup component add rust-src
cargo install --force --locked cargo-contract
nvm install 20
```

_Note: you still have to download or build `substrate-contracts-code`, you can get it [from here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node)_

* (_1_) Frontend dependencies - You need to install these tools to be able to develop or run the frontend of the game. In this case, the pre-built contracts and pre-generated client code is going to be used.
* (_2_) Backend dependencies - You need to install these tools to be able to develop or run the backend of the game. If you modify anything in the contract code, you need these tools to be able to build the contracts, and re-generate the part of the code that needs to be changed to reflect the changes in the contract.

# Building

Now you can start building the game.

* First you have to clone the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SIOCODE-Open/not-a-bird
```

* Enter the repository, and run the following command to install Node.JS dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

* Now you should start `substrate-contracts-node` locally, so that you can _deploy the contracts_, and _generate the contract data in the contract client libraries_:

_In one terminal you should run:_

```bash
substrate-contracts-node --dev
```

_In another terminal you should run:_

```bash
npm run deploy:contracts
```

* Now you can build the game

```bash
npm run build
```

The game will be ready as a _single-page application_ in the `packages/app-game/dist` directory.

You can also run `npm run serve`, which will start the build pipeline in watch mode, and serves the game locally.

## Modifying the backend

If you modify the contract code, you will have to rebuild all contracts from scratch, and deploy them locally so that client libraries are re-generated.

After modifications, use this command to build all contracts:

```bash
npm run build:contracts
```

If you want to build only a _single contract_, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run c:<contract name>
```

For example, if you want to build the `water` contract, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run c:water
```
