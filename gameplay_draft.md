We are in Space. We are the protagonist.  
We aim to make the world a multiplantery species.  
We have to terraform planets to make this happen.

### Outro - Further

[OGame](https://gameforge.com/en-GB/play/ogame) or [Little Alchemy](https://littlealchemy.com/) are the inspirations.

From there onwards in can either go into **Puzzle / Crafting** Game genre _(alchemy)_ or into a **Strategy / Space Simulation** game _(ogame)_. Both of them are successful games. Born in the big second generation of the Web. Played & maintained till this day.  
The Game principles are battle tested in user experience & they manged to established a economical sustainable model over two decades.  
We also glimpse to other breakers of this era. f.e. Farmville.
