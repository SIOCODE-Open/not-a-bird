# Notes

Just by trying I don't get the expected result.

I will read the docs more conscious and do it again.

- Immuntable is nice but has its obvious downside

Proxy Forwarding

A Contract calls another Contract

State is stored in the contract not in the proxy contract

Selectors are a thing

Selectors _ is the retrieve function

There is delegation contract

Code needs to sit on chain, but not to be instatnitea

Storage layout needs to be identical

There is callBuilder which helps

Callflages are important

First non lazy, non maping gets stored

Order delegte call matters

Key Compatible

If use lazy and mapping things work diffrents

Storage layout is identlical

Constructor has not logic

There are delegate dependcy locks

... maybe now ... continue reading later
