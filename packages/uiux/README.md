# Figma

The main goal is to throw some time against Design.  
I prefer Dive into Figma and think about while doing something.  
So I choose colors, typography and borders and spacing and so on.

In this process I thought have a sketchy look could be cool.  
From the current Asset Generation, adding sketchy outline, notebook, drawings, into the prompt should be achievable.  
It solve the problem that the Design can look quite constience without rip a leg out ^^

Anyways.
